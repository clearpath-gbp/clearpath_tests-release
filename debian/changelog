ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (2.3.1-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Fix a bug where the e-stop test could cause the test node to crash
  * Add a 2s delay between clearing the e-stop and moving the wheels to allow CAN reconnections as needed
  * Remove CAN device ID count for platforms that don't use CANopen
  * Lower the time threshold for linear drive test to 0.75 (from 0.8)
  * Change the default serial device for Jackal

ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (2.3.0-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Allow symlinks to the device handle
  * Fix serial MCU tests
  * Ensure the firmware is 2.3 or higher to allow fan control; otherwise just skip the fan test
  * Add support for lateral driving test for omni platforms (#5 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/5>)
  * Re-enable the fan tests (#4 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/4>)
  * Remove rotation test (#3 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/3>)

ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (0.2.9-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Rewrite rotation test (#2 <https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/clearpath_tests/issues/2>)
    * Overhaul the logic of the rotation to use an accumulator instead of relying on the latest odom data. Factor in the rate of the EKF + the odometry twist instead of just looking at positional data. On 00005 we're still overshooting slightly, but it's now within the margin of error
  * Append the can interface to the node name to suppress duplicate node name warning

ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (0.2.8-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Use the last 7 bits for the CAN ID, sort the IDs in the final report
  * Note that the IDs are CANopen, and could be incorrect for other devices.

ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (0.2.7-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Move the confirmation about the lights being in the normal state before we call start()
  * Log the hardware ID and firmware version reported by the MCU status topic
  * Move the TF listener implementation to its own file
  * Add tests, refactor & reformat to address errors they caught

ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (0.2.4-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Reduce the minimum duration for a rotation. Log possible false-positives during the rotation test. Print the calculated duration error for the rotation & drive tests
  * Log the version of clearpath_tests in the report
  * Increase the length of expected lynx messages to 5, cast the length to an integer before comparing it

ros-jazzy-clearpath-tests (0.2.3-1bookworm) bookworm; urgency=high

  * Invert the angle of the lateral test
  * Add a mutex to prevent issues with reading & writing the current & previous orientations asynchronously; this sometimes causes false positives or false negatives during the test
  * Don't fail if we get controller_manager rate errors
  * Add newline between average motor currents in report
  * Increase the allowed margin of error on the IMU test to 20% (from 10%)
  * Add an extra confirmation that the lights are in a controllable state before starting the test
